<h3>Steps in making Pizza</h3>

    <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or parchment paper dusted with cornmeal to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
    <li>Add your desired toppings, such as pepperoni slices, sliced mushrooms, sliced bell peppers, and sliced onions.</li>
    <li>Drizzle a little olive oil over the pizza and sprinkle with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the assembled pizza to the preheated stone using the pizza peel or parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
    <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
